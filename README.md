# Questions

1. What	do	you	like	about	your	solution?
  I think that my solution meets most of the requirements and that the code is kept simple. 
2. What	do	you	dislike	about	your	solution?
  My solution didn't take full advantage of the minimal Redux React boilerplate as I used redux-thunk instead of redux-saga.
3. If	you	had	a	full	day	more	to	work	on	this,	what	would	you	improve?
  I would probably have designed a cleaner look of the application and improved the highlighting mechanism. 
4. If	you	would	start	from	scratch	now,	what	would	you	do	differently?
  I would have chosen to use redux-thunk from the start rather than mess around with redux-saga which I am not that familiar with. This would have saved me a lot of time and I wouldn't have to do that many adjustments in the folder structure.
